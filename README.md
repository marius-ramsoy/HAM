# HAM
HAM emulator for quickly approximating magnetic fields in cosmic simulations form non MHD simulations
The required halo catalogues, density fields and magnetic fields may be found here:

It is also possible to use your own simulations instead.  The magnetic fields produced by this model are not particularly accurate, but attempt to reproduce some of the global properties of a cosmic magnetic field produced by galactic feedback.  This can be done in a day on a small cluster (shorter if you choose a high mass threshold) rather than months of processing time using 1000s of computing cores modelling a magnetic field whose evolution we cannot capture with current resolution limits and mathematical methods.
